// This is a simple hello world program
// This program also has a test to see if I can name a java file/class "Class" without issues. 

public class Lab1 { // Class name must be same as filename. But it is possible to name a class "Class"
    public static void main(String[] args) { // void is the return value type
        
    }
}
